### Double reads test case:

(1) *double_input/reads_1.fastq*:
copied from https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/sample_data/reads_1.fastq

(2) *double_input/reads_2.fastq*:
copied from https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/sample_data/reads_2.fastq

(3) *double_output/aux-info/unmapped_names.txt*:
copied from https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/sample_data/unmapped_random.txt

(4) *expected_double_output/unmapped_by_salmon_1.fa*:
expected output file by `salmontools`, based on input files (1), (2) and (3).

(5) *expected_double_output/unmapped_by_salmon_2.fa*:
another expected output file by `salmontools`, based on input files (1), (2) and (3).

### Single read test case:

(1) *single_input/single_read.fastq*:
the first 10,000 lines of `SRR074262.fastq`, which is located at:
ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR074/SRR074262/SRR074262.fastq.gz

(2) *single_output/aux-info/unmapped_names.txt*:
generated by salmontools, based on the short index and the file (1).

(3) *expected_single_output/unmapped_by_salmon.fa*:
expected output file by `salmontools`, based on input files (1) and (2).
